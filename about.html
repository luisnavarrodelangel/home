<p>explore the concept of pervasive memory experienced through new media, specifically
Facebook. As a generator of mémoires involontaires (Landsberg, 2004, p.17) and as a hegemonic
lieu de memoire (Nora, 1986) Facebook not only archive photos but also forces the users to
confront them again. In its “on this day” app, the algorithm forbids the user to forget by
recreating painful memories at unexpected moments (Dzieza, 2015). This artwork looks to create
reflection on the technologies of memory, their commodification and their sociopolitical use
(Landsberg, 2004, p.129)</p>
